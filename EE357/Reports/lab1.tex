\begin{exercise}[]{What protocol does "ping" and "traceroute" use?}
  \begin{solution}
  \par{~}
  ping and traceroute use ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocol). See Figure \ref{fig1}

\begin{exercise}[]{What is the IP address of www.sjtu.edu.cn? }
  \begin{solution}
  \par{~} From my experiment, IP address of www.sjtu.edu.cn is 202.120.2.119

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{exercise}[]{What is the average round trip time (RTT) from your VM to www.sjtu.edu.cn and mit.edu.
    Analyze the reason for the difference of their RTTs.}
  \begin{solution}
  \par{~}
  RTT for www.sjtu.edu.cn is 7.706 ms on average. RTT for mit.edu is 214.188 ms on average. More details can be found in Figure \ref{fig:ex3}.

  The reason why RTT for mit takes longer than that for SJTU is probably because in order to reach the host in MIT, the packet has to travel through more routers, thus increasing transmission delay, queuing delay, etc.
